Broadly, my research interests include labour and public economics, as well as the economics of education, health, migration, and crime. I'm particularly interested in questions related to integration and immigration. My current research examines how institutional structures and policy design influence labour market integration and human capital accumulation among newly arrived immigrants in Sweden.

My current projects have received the required ethical approval and research funding. This page will be updated when relevant progress have been made.
